# InternNet
Grizzly InternNET is a review website that allows Georgia Gwinnett College 
students to assign ratings to any previous internships or entry-level jobs 
related to their degrees. The idea for Grizzly InternNET was founded by 
Ruby Hernandez, and developed in collaboration with her group members 
Ryan Gambrell, John Brandt, and Nicholas Porter.
